-- create a table:
create table TABLENAME (
    COLUMN1 datatype,
    COLUMN2 datatype,
    COLUMN3, datatype,
    ) ;

-- Therefore to create a table called TEST with two columns - ID of type integer,
-- and Name of type varchar, we could create it using the following SQL statement:
create table TEST (
    ID integer,
    NAME varchar(30)
);

-- Now let's create a table called COUNTRY with an ID column, a 
-- two letter country code column, and a variable length country name column:
create table COUNTRY (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    CCODE char(2),
    NAME varchar(60),
    PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);

-- In the above example the ID column has the "NOT NULL" constraint added after 
-- the datatype - meaning that it cannot contain a NULL or an empty value. If you
-- look at the last row in the create table statement above you will note that we 
-- are using ID as a Primary Key and the database does not allow Primary Keys to 
-- have NULL values. A Primary Key is a unique identifier in a table, and using
-- Primary Keys can help speed up your queries significantly.


-- If the table you are trying to create already exists in the database, you will
-- get an error indicating "table XXX.YYY already exists". To circumvent this 
-- error, either create a table with a different name or first DROP the existing 
-- table. It is quite common to issue a DROP before doing a CREATE in test and 
-- development scenarios.

drop table COUNTRY;
create table COUNTRY (
    ID integer PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    CCODE char(2),
    NAME varchar(60)
    );

-- WARNING: before dropping a table ensure that it doesn't contain important data 
-- that can't be recovered easily.

-- Note that if the table does not already exist and you try to drop it, you will
-- see an error like "XXX.YYY is an undefined name". You can ignore this error as 
-- long as the subsequent CREATE statement executed successfully.
